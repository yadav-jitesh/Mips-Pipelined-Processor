# Mips-Pipelined-Processor
5 cycle Mips Processor for fetching Multiple Instructions per cycle
This is basic MIPS Processor piplined to 5 stages for fetching Multiple Instructions and executing instructions per cycle.
Data hazrads and Forwarding Units are not placed in the implementation and hence any data dependencies will cause error for the execution
I have used VHDL language for the implementation for each entity in the processor.
